I am Jake Trauger and I am a 4th year Statistics PhD student at the University of Michigan. I study the theory of deep learning under my advisor [Ambuj Tewari](https://www.ambujtewari.com/). I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics & Computer Science along with Mathematics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have also worked as a Data Science Engineer at Simspace inbetween my undergrad and grad school careers. My resume can be found [here](https://traugerjacob.github.io/files/Resume_Jacob_Trauger.pdf).

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in bridging the gap between practice and theory in modern deep learning. Specifically, I enjoy tackling theoretical problems that are motivated from practical concerns.

Miscellaneous
======
Outside of work, I try to stay as active by doing activies such as rock climbing and fencing. I am also big music fan and I enjoy playing the guitar and I am learning the piano and harmonica. Finally, I follow Philadelphia professional sports and collegiate sports from the University of Illinois/Michigan.
